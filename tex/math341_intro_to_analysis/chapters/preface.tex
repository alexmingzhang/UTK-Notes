\chapter*{Preface}
These are my notes for the \textbf{Introduction to Analysis} (MATH 341) course at the University of Tennessee. It is compiled from several sources including lecture notes by Dr. Michael Frazier and Dr. Peter Humphries, as well as online resources such as the Mathematics Stack Exchange and even GPT-4.

The first few weeks of the course are spent reviewing the material taught in \textbf{Introduction to Abstract Mathematics} (MATH 300): logic, set theory, number systems, and cardinality. They serve as a ``primer'' for the following material on real analysis. New topics begin from Chapter \ref{chapter-sequences} and onwards.
