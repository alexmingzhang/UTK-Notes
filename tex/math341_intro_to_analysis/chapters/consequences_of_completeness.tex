\begin{thmbox}{$\N$ is not Bounded Above}{}
    \begin{proof}
        Suppose for contradiction $\N$ is bounded above. Since $\N$ is not empty, then $\N$ has a supremum in $\R$. Let $s \coloneq \sup \N \in \R$. Then $n \leq s$ for all $n \in \N$. By the Peano axioms, $n$ has a successor $n+1 \in \N$, so $n+1 \leq s$ for all $n \in \N$. Therefore, $n \leq s - 1$ for all $n \in \N$. This contradicts $s$ being the least upper bound for $\N$.
    \end{proof}

\begin{thmbox}{Archimedean Principle}{archimedean}
    Suppose $x,y \in \R$ where $x > 0$. Then, there exists $n \in \N$ such that $nx > y$.
    \tcblower
    \textbf{Intuition:} This is basically an extension of the fact that $\N$ is not bounded above.
    \begin{proof}
        Since $\sfrac{y}{x}$ is not an upper bound for $\N$, then there exists $n \in \N$ such that $n > \sfrac{y}{x}$. Since $x > 0$, then $nx > y$.
    \end{proof}

\begin{thmbox}{Density of $\Q$ in $\R$}{}
    Suppose $x,y \in \R$ where $x < y$. Then there exists $r \in Q$ such that $x < r < y$.
    \tcblower
    \textbf{Intuition:} Given any two different real numbers, there's some rational number between them.
    \begin{proof}
        We will consider three cases:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item If $x \geq 0$, then $0 \leq x < y$. Since $y - x > 0$, then by the \nameref{thm:archimedean}, there exists $n \in \N$ such that $n(y-x) > 1$. We want to show there is a natural number between $nx$ and $ny$. Let $A \coloneq \{ k \in \N : k > nx \}$. Since $\N$ isn't bounded above, then $A$ is not empty. By the \nameref{thm:wop}, $A$ has a minimum. Let $m \coloneq \min A$. Then $m > nx$, and $m-1 \leq nx$. Thus, $m \leq nx+1$, so:
            \[ nx < m \leq nx+1 < ny \]
            Dividing through by $n$ yields $x < \sfrac{m}{n} < y$. Note that $m,n \in \N \subseteq \Z$, so $\sfrac{m}{n} \in \Q$.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{proof}
