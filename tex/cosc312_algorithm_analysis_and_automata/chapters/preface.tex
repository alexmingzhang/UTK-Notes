\chapter*{Preface}
These are my notes for the \textbf{Algorithm Analysis and Automata} course at UT Knoxville. They are a compilation of lecture notes by Dr. Michael W. Berry, lecture notes from the University of Illinois' CS 373\footnote{\url{https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs373/fa2010/lectures/}}, and Michael Sisper's \textit{Introduction to the Theory of Compution}, as well as online resources like the CS Stack Exchange and Wikipedia.
