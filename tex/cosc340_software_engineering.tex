\chapter{Software Development Life Cycle}
Our goal is to deliver software that meets expectations on time while keeping in budget.

Ideally, the software engineering development cycle would look like this:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Requirements
    \item Design
    \item Implementation
    \item Verification
    \item Maintenance
\end{itemize}

More traditional methodologies.

\section{Waterfall}

\begin{dfnbox}{Waterfall}{}
    The \dfntxt{waterfall} SDLC follows a sequence of steps, which results in finished software at the end.
\end{dfnbox}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Centralized and standardized approach to software development
    \item Not nimble or responsive
    \item Conception, development, delivery, support, and obsolescence
    \item Move on to next phase when management approves
    \item Each phase well documented and independent of other stages' documentation
\end{itemize}

Although there is no prescribed way to use the waterfall methodology, it follows these general phases:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Investigation: brain storm, explore ideas and customer problems
    \item Requirements: gather customer requirements; refine initial ideas with functional needs and wants
    \item Design: detailed model and architecture of software; should make project plan, marketing documents, and design documents
    \item Implementation: Development and testing; deliver master source code tree and appropriate documentation
    \item Verification: test and evaluate software and security; much will be done in implementation as well
    \item Maintenance:
    \item Obsolescence: product reaches end of useful lifetime; how to obsolete product
\end{enumerate}

\section{Agile}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Set of guiding principles; not a methodology or framework
    \item Iterative approach to software development
    \item Each iteration gets closer to a finished product
    \item Agile methodologies include Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming (XP), Lean, Crystal
\end{itemize}

Agile prioritizes four key values:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Individuals and interactions
    \item Working software
    \item Customer collaboration
    \item Responding to change
\end{enumerate}

Scrum
\begin{itemize}
    \item Most popular agile framework
    \item Helps small teams build big products
    \item
\end{itemize}
