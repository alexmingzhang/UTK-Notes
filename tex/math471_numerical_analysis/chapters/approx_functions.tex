\chapter{Approximation of Functions}

We've already seen one way of approximating functions by their Taylor polynomial. Although the approximation is excellent for values ``near'' the initial point, error can quickly grow for more ``distant'' values. One way we can combat this error is by \dfntxt{interpolation}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Lagrange
    \item Hermite
    \item Spline
\end{itemize}
